A repo for my learnings of the basic libraries need to build neural networks.

Libraries that I cover:
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Tensorflow 2.0 (including Keras)

This repo just contains four jupyter notenooks corresponding to each of the above mentioned libraries.

These 4 notebooks are just me following along the docs and executing the code. Nothing more than that.
