A repo for my learnings of the basic libraries need to build neural networks.

Libraries that I cover:
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Tensorflow 2.0 (including Keras)

This repo just contains four jupyter notenooks corresponding to each of the above mentioned libraries.

These 4 notebooks are just me following along the docs and executing the code. Nothing more than that.

Installation:
I've exported my environment to a file called environment.yml file

You can create an environment from it using this:
	conda env create -f environment. yml

FYI, the environment contains other libs as well that aren't required.
