A repo for my learnings of the basic libraries need to build neural networks.

Libraries that I cover:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow 2.0 (including Keras)

Installation:
I've exported my environment to a file called environment.yml file

You can create an environment from it using this:
conda env create -f environment. yml

FYI, the environment contains other libs as well that aren't required.

Only the ipynb notebooks contain the original code, all other folders and files are just supplementary material.

The recommended flow of notebooks:

- Numpy Notebook
- Pandas Notebook
- Matplotlib Notebook
- Tensorflow Fundamentals

- Keras Notebooks:
  - Basic Image Classification
  - Basic Text Classification
  - Text Classiciation with Tf Hub
  - Regression
  - Overfit - Underfit & Solving them
  - Save & Load Models
  - Tuner
